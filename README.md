# Web-Server

It is a basic HTTP Webserver that is implemented using just the Standard java api's.
It doesnt have any compile time dependency. At runtime in order to run Test cases you
would need JUnit 4.12 jars in your classpath.

This project is as simple as a direct import in your choice of Java based IDE and you are good to go without any dependency. Even i have avoided log4j for that matter and have used java.util Logging. 
I have also create batch script to spin up the server easily and have implemented xml config parser in 
order to have all the setting at one place and easy to configure in future.
